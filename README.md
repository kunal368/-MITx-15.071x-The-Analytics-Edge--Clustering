Solved Problems like Document Clustering, Market Segmentation for Airlines and Predicting Stock Returns with Cluster-Then-Predict

1. Document Clustering: In 1st problem, we'll be clustering articles published on Daily Kos, an American political blog that publishes news and opinion articles written from a progressive point of view. Daily Kos was founded by Markos Moulitsas in 2002, and as of September 2014, the site had an average weekday traffic of hundreds of thousands of visits.

2. Marketing Segmentation for Airlines: Clustering is a common technique for market segmentation since it automatically finds similar groups given a data set. In 2nd problem, we'll see how clustering can be used to find similar groups of customers who belong to an airline's frequent flyer program. The airline is trying to learn more about its customers so that it can target different customer segments with different types of mileage offers. 

3. Predicting Stock Returns with Cluster-Then-Predict: When selecting which stocks to invest in, investors seek to obtain good future returns. In 3rd problem, we will first use clustering to identify clusters of stocks that have similar returns over time. Then, we'll use logistic regression to predict whether or not the stocks will have positive future returns.
